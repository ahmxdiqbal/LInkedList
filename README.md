# LInkedList

Wrote a program that creates a cross-reference listing of the words in a text file, using a linked list to put the words in order, and another linked list associated with each word to keep the line numbers of the words.  The input files contain lines of text with only words, spaces, and only periods and commas as punctuation. Wrote both lists from scratch (without using the STL) using classes.
